## About Me

My name is Vojtěch Tóth and this is my personal web page.

You can find my digital garden and I plan to occasionally write a blog post as an exercise. Check the [[Vault]] for my obsidian notes and [[Blog]] to read an article. Lately I've been working on a minimal torch-like framework for training neural networks from scratch.
